  Bans on books or cell phones in schools are a complex issue with both potential benefits and drawbacks for students.
  While some argue bans can improve focus and academic performance, others contend they limit learning, restrict freedom of thought, and stifle intellectual growth.
  School policies can significantly impact student behavior, safety, and learning. Strict, punitive policies may lead to increased behavioral problems, lower academic achievement, and negative self-esteem, especially for marginalized students.
  Conversely, positive and restorative approaches can promote better behavior and a more positive school climate, addressing underlying causes and supporting student development.
  Students may find it harder to connect with family or friends during emergencies, and may be more likely to engage in disruptive behavior if they feel their phones are unfairly restricted. 
  it is good because it help pupils to study harder and score the highest in a test or exams.

They have incredible upper body strength, really strong jaw muscles.
So, they bring a lot to a fight," she explained.
But that doesn't mean one gorilla could take on 100 human men! "I think just the sheer numbers that the humans have would mean that the gorilla would probably eventually be overpowered.
yes,because to show how human have capability to go against the giant gorilla.
The initial question, originating on a Reddit forum, quickly gained traction on platforms like TikTok, reaching a broader audience through influencers and popular personalities like MrBeast. 
The educational aspect arises as experts are now weighing in, adding a layer of scientific analysis and critical thinking to the initial entertainment aspect. 
Claim: 100 unarmed men could likely defeat a single adult male gorilla, though it would come at a high cost in terms of casualties and injuries.
Evidence:100 men would have a significant numerical advantage, allowing them to overwhelm the gorilla's attack capabilities. 
Reasoning:The sheer number of men would make it difficult for the gorilla to effectively defend itself.

 Messing with electronics can be very dangerous.
 Chromebook batteries are made with lithium-ion.
 If they’re damaged, they can catch fire, leak chemicals, or even exploded.
Here’s what can happen:
Burns: Batteries can overheat and cause burns.
Fires: Damaged batteries can start fires at home or school.
Smoke Inhalation: Breathing in battery smoke is harmful.
Discipline: Kids can face school punishment or even legal trouble.
Device Loss: Most Chromebooks are loaned by schools.
Breaking them can mean having to pay for a new one or face other consequences as decided by your child’s school.
It’s not just about the device—it’s about your child’s safety and the safety of everyone around them.
Guide kids in asking the right questions
It’s okay for kids to be curious, creative, and even a little silly online.
But common sense and safety should always come first.
Consider creating a questions checklist when in doubt: 
•    “Is this safe?”
•    “Does this help me or hurt me?”
•    “Would I be proud to show this to my teacher, grandma, or a police officer?”It’s tempting to say “no more TikTok!” But the truth is, social media isn’t going away.
Instead of banning it completely, we can teach kids to use it wisely.
Evidence and Examples:
The challenge encourages students to insert metal objects into charging ports, creating a direct path for electricity and potentially causing electric shocks or fires.
A Connecticut middle school student was even hospitalized after a fire started due to this trend.
Reasoning:
Individuals have a moral and ethical duty to protect themselves and others from harm.
The Chromebook challenge directly contradicts this responsibility by promoting risky behavior that can lead to injury and property damage.
Claim:
primarily TikTok, involves students jamming metal objects like paperclips and pencils into the charging ports of Chromebooks.
his activity is dangerous as it can cause permanent damage, electrical shorts, and even fire hazards.

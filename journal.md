A large protest took place in the school,where thousand of pupils gathered to express concept of what we have been learning e.g,problem solving,technology,or data analysis.With many voices concerns about us what we were learning about how it was great and it  will help us in future.
most business today could not complete succcessfully in the world market without the use of computer technology.bisiness use computer for the following purpose:1 to create advertising materials.2 to control inventory.

   Federal restrictions.in december 2019,the united states army and navy banned tiktok on government devices after the department of defence labeled it security risk.before the policy change,army recruiters had been  usingbthe platform to attract young people.
   the supreme court is upholding the federal law set to ban the social media app on sunday unless it cuts ties with bytedance .the supreme court ruled against tiktok on friday,rejecting the short-form vidio app's apeal of law .concerns that chenese government could manipulate content and gain accces to sensitive user data through the app.
   A smoking policy covers a workplace's rules regarding smoking and tobacco use.many companies do not allow smoking on their premises.its's important for employees to know where and when they can smoke, if applicable.implementation can be defined as one of the key stages in policymaking usually followed by evaluation.you should becareful when investing monney in apps so that your money cannot go  away,because as you can se tiktok is going to be banned.the ones who invest their money will go with nothing.tiktok is rife with dangerous misinformation that the government can and should rightly ban.

 Technology is a key part of modern aviation, from air traffic control systems to automated flight assistance. Possible Connections to Computer Science.
Air Traffic Control Systems – How do computer algorithms manage airspace and prevent collisions?
Automation & AI in Aviation – The role of autopilot systems, real-time alerts, and AI-driven decision-making.
Software Errors & Bugs – How can coding flaws or miscommunication between different software systems contribute to accidents?
Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) – Did poor interface design or unclear alerts play a role in the crash?
Cybersecurity in Aviation – Could hacking, jamming, or cyber vulnerabilities pose risks in air traffic management?
Big Data & Predictive Analytics – How could machine learning be used to predict and prevent accidents?  advanced collision avoidance systems, real-time data analysis using artificial intelligence (AI), improved aircraft maintenance monitoring, enhanced air traffic control systems, and sophisticated pilot training simulators, all working together to predict and prevent potential hazards, optimize flight paths, and provide pilots with critical information in real-time. 
 Aircraft Systems:
Enhanced Ground Proximity Warning System (GPWS): More accurate terrain awareness and alerts to prevent controlled flight into terrain (CFIT) accidents. 
Head-Up Displays (HUDs): Provide pilots with critical flight information directly on their line of sight, improving situational awareness. 
Synthetic Vision Systems (SVS): Generate a virtual image of the terrain, particularly useful in low visibility conditions. 
Automated flight control systems: Can assist pilots with critical maneuvers, reducing human error. 
Overall, the integration of advanced technology in aviation has the potential to significantly enhance safety by providing real-time situational awareness, automated decision-making capabilities, and preventative measures to address potential hazards throughout the flight cycle.

 Technology can act as a powerful bridge between generations by providing accessible communication tools that cater to different preferences, allowing individuals to express themselves comfortably regardless of age or cultural background. For instance, utilizing video conferencing platforms with translation capabilities can facilitate cross-cultural conversations, while project management software with visual elements can help bridge understanding gaps between generations with varying digital literacy levels. 
Maintaining professionalism and cultural sensitivity within this technological framework is crucial. This means respecting individuals' communication styles, offering training on appropriate digital etiquette, and ensuring that technology is used to enhance understanding rather than replace human interaction. By thoughtfully integrating technology while being mindful of diverse cultural nuances, organizations can foster a more inclusive environment where all generations can contribute effectively.
